👋 Hey there! I go by @jrdaiv or Anthony Hernandez if you're feeling formal. Welcome to my corner of the tech universe—feel free to explore my projects!

👀 I'm passionate about uncovering the many layers of this beautiful world of technology. Whether it's front-end finesse or backend logic, I'm always diving deeper and learning more.

🌱 Currently exploring Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and React Native. I believe in learning by doing—every bug, every breakthrough, every late-night "aha!" moment is part of the journey.

🤝 Open to collaborations! If you're building something cool or want to brainstorm ideas, I'm all ears.

📫 Reach out via GitHub, LinkedIn, or social media. Let's connect and create something meaningful.
