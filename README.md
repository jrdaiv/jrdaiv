- 👋 Hi, I go by @jrdaiv or Anthony Hernandez if you want to be formal. Come see my project.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning different ways of this beautiful world of tech. Slowly but surely i will be able to memorize these languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, but while im learning the wonders of this language always 100% in it trying to figure it out or learn new things.
- 💞️ I’m not quite there yet to be able to look for collaborating but once i do i might have some few exciting things i would love to do. 
- 📫 How to reach me? Basically would be on any social media, github, etc. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: - When i figure something out i'll come back to update :)
