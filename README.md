- 👋 Hi, I go by @jrdaiv or Anthony Hernandez if you want to be formal. Come see my projects.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning different ways of this beautiful world of tech. Slowly but surely I will be able to memorize these languages I dive into.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, javascript, typescript, and React-Native but while im learning the wonders of these languages I've always been 100% in trying to figure it out or learn new things.
- 💞️ I’m free to any collaborations! 
- 📫 How to reach me? Get a hold of me by social media, github, linkedin etc.
